Task1: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
In this task, Analysed data using explorative data analysis and developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

Task2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
In this task, Analyzed the given data and Builded a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Task3: SPAM SMS DETECTION
In this task, analyzed the given data Builded an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, support Vector Machines, Gradient Boost, KNN, ADA boost, Decision Tree to identify spam messages
